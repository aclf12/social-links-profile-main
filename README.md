## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

In this activity I did not use any new knowledge. However, I managed to solidify many of the things I already learned here.

### Continued development

By constantly studying the HTML and CSS languages, I see that I am making great progress in my knowledge. I believe there is still more to learn about WEB development. I have seen that my perception of programming - although not yet in an actual programming language - has improved a lot, compared to my first projects. My next advancement will be in the JavaScript programming language.
